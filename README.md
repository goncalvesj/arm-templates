# Azure ARM templates

The purpose of this repository is to provide examples of Azure ARM templates that I used to create different types of Azure Resources.

## Templates

ARM Template that creates an Azure Storage Account to host Azure B2C custom UI files:
- Azure.B2C.Storage

ARM Template that creates Azure App Services that require the .Net Core 3.1 runtime:
- Azure.AppService.ExtensionAndSetting
